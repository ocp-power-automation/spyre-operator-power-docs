# Spyre Operator for IBM Power User's Guide

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-22

This document provides an overview of the Spyre Operator for IBM Power. You will learn how to set up and configure the necessary software stack to make the Spyre Accelerators available to AI workloads that run on Red Hat OpenShift.

## [Introduction to the Spyre Operator](docs/intro/introduction.md)

The Spyre Operator allows users and cluster administrators to configure Spyre in Red Hat OpenShift. It works as a centralized one-stop operator that coordinates many essential components, which can hide the complexity of the Spyre enablement processes in the cluster. The operator ensures that pods are scheduled to nodes with available Spyre devices and manages device allocation at runtime.
